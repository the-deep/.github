# What is DEEP?
**DEEP** is an intelligent web-based platform offering a suite of collaborative tools tailored towards humanitarian crisis responses. It includes common analysis workflows and frameworks for thinking using both structured and unstructured, quantitative and qualitative data. By using a customizable analysis frameworks, users can easily catalog information contained in large amounts of documents and export it to a variety of formats. Supporting this, DEEP has a long term vision of using text analysis techniques in order to streamline the process of sourcing information from online sources and semi-automating document information extraction. Although the platform is meant to be a collaborative space, it is open-source and available to be deployed in private server environments. Data in DEEP is visible only to users granted access to a project space and is stored using modern web technology standards.

Development of DEEP began in early 2016 and it is a collaborative project governed by [ACAPS](https://deephelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/acaps.org), [IDMC](http://www.internal-displacement.org/), [IFRC](http://ifrc.org/), [JIPS](http://jips.org/), [UNHCR](http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/), [UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/), [UN OCHA](https://www.unocha.org/), [OHCHR](https://www.ohchr.org/) and [Okular-Analytics](https://www.okular-analytics.com/).
